                <b>Basic Information:</b> We collect and securely store your Name, Birth Date, Gender, and Photo. These details help us establish your profile. You have the freedom to modify this information at any time.<br><br>

                <b>Contact Information:</b> We collect your phone number, email, location, and company name, securely and encrypted in our database. This information allows us to stay in touch with you, notify you about any platform changes, and connect local customers and sellers for transactions. Your location is essential for connecting you with nearby services and products.<br><br>

                <b>Payment Information:</b> During transactions, we collect payment details, such as the contact number associated with your account and transaction history, refunds, replacements, purchases, and orders.

                <b>Basic Information:</b> Your name, birthdate, and gender help create your profile and verify your eligibility for using our platform.<br><br>

                Please note that data collection aligns with our system requirements and is aimed at enhancing your experience and flexibility.

        <section class="how-use-info-content">
            <span>How we Use Information</span>
            <p class="policy-content">
                The information you provide in our platform serves various essential purposes:<br><br>

                <b>Personal Information:</b> The data you share, such as your name, gender, and birth date, is utilized to create and customize your profile. This helps us understand who you are and ensures your profile accurately represents you.<br><br>

                <b>Contact Information:</b> We use your contact information to stay in touch with you. This includes sending important messages and emails related to our system and your transactions. When you purchase a product or service from a seller on our platform, we also share your contact and email address with them. This fosters communication and ensures a smooth exchange of products and services.<br><br>

                <b>Payment Details:</b> Your payment information is stored in our system only when you permit us to do so. It is temporarily stored in our secure database. This information is crucial for making online payments for products and services. If you are a seller, we use this data for subscription renewal purposes, facilitating a seamless experience.<br><br>

                <b>Metadata:</b> We collect certain metadata related to your activities on our platform. This includes the date and time of actions like logging in, registering, conducting transactions, refunds, purchases, orders, and replacements. This metadata serves multiple functions: it provides you with a clear record of your activities on our platform, helps resolve any issues that may arise, and serves as a valuable proof in the event of any discrepancies or disputes.<br><br>

                Face Photo: Uploading a face photo is a requirement in our system. This photo ensures that the product or service you have taken is in your presence. It enhances transparency and security, offering you confidence that what you've ordered matches your expectations.

        <section class="data-security-content">
            <span>Data Security: Protecting Your Information</span>
            <p class="policy-content">
                At Local Business, we take data security seriously and employ dual layers of protection to safeguard your sensitive information from unauthorized access:<br><br>

                <b style="font-size:20px">User Side Security</b> <br><br>
                Two-Step Authentication: We offer users the option to enable two-step authentication after registration. It's entirely at the user's discretion whether they choose to implement this additional layer of security. We encourage users to do so as it enhances their account's protection. Please note that if a user chooses not to enable two-step authentication and their account is accessed without permission via any means, Local Business cannot be held responsible. We are committed to not utilizing your information for unauthorized access to your account.<br><br>

                <b style="font-size:20px">Platform Side Security</b> <br><br>
                Robust Data Storage: Your data is securely stored in our database, using a variety of advanced security algorithms. This means that your information remains inaccessible to unauthorized parties unless explicitly shared by you. In the unlikely event of a security breach, even if an attacker gains access to our database, they would only be able to view your basic data. This data is stored securely and does not personally identify you, as it comprises common details. Your facial image, however, is stored with the utmost security, ensuring that other users cannot identify you solely by your image. <br><br>

                <b style="font-size:20px">Transaction Authorization</b> <br><br>
                It's important to emphasize that we always seek your permission before any transaction is carried out on our platform, especially concerning payment details. Without your explicit permission, no transaction is performed in our system.

Rest assured, all your information is securely stored in our database and is used exclusively for your benefit, with the exception of contact and email information. This contact and email data is necessary for communication with sellers or administrators. However, any misuse of this data will result in appropriate action taken against the responsible party.<br><br>

                As for your payment details, we only retain them during the transaction process, and they are not stored unless you explicitly permit us to do so. Your payment information is temporarily stored in our database solely for the purpose of facilitating transactions.
